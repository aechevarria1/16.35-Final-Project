Relay Simulator

16.35 Real-Time Systems and Software

We have created a simulation of a track and field relay race. This relay is a race between two teams consisting of four athletes each. In the figure below, the red line indicates the track. Vehicles may not overlap on the track, which will be further discussed in section 3, Passing. All of the vehicles begin offset because of this constraint, and then merge onto the track. The blue zones indicate the sections where vehicles may “hand off the baton”, which is where one runner stops running and the next leg begins running.

More detail can be found in the Final_Report and Final_SRS files under the documentation folder
